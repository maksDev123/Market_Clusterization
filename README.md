# Market Clusterization

In this project, I conducted exploration of industry best practices in clusterization, employing RFM Analysis for the purpose of Marketing Segmentation

Used different algorithms:
* Hierarchical clustering
* DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
* K-means

Determined the number of clusters using:
* Gap Statistics
* Silhouette score
* Elbow rule
